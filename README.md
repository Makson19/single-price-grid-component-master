## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


In this project I learned to use the Grid Layout and some of its properties. Below is a snippet of the CSS code I used:

```css
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 0.9fr 1.1fr;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-areas: "w1 w1"
                          "w2 w3";
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to practice CSS grid and SASS.
